AquaInsights Pro - Handoff README

This package contains:
- design_tokens.json (colors, typography, layout tokens)
- COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md (component summary)
- motion_spec.json (key motion specs)
- Lottie placeholders (mascot_blink, wqi_meter_slosh, coin_shower)
- screens_360x800 (placeholder 360x800 PNGs)
- playstore/feature_graphic.gif (animated placeholder)

Notes:
- Replace Lottie placeholders with exported Lottie JSON from After Effects / Lottie.
- Provide production-ready Figma file: pages named exactly as requested by the brief.
- This automated merge script created placeholder assets for 'ai_videos' (GIFs) as samples. Replace with AI-generated MP4s if available.
