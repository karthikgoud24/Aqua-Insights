AquaInsights Pro — Updated Project Merge
This package contains the AquaInsights Pro updated project with the following changes performed by the assistant:

- Replaced placeholder Analysis screen with a corrected, full visual-analysis feature (merged and adjusted from the 'full' project).
- Enhanced Kids Corner: added a horizontal gallery of 10 playful animated GIF "videos" for kids and comics/tips tiles (placeholders).
- Expanded Sanitation & Treatment guide with images and detailed steps. Added multiple illustrative images in assets/images/.
- Added placeholder Lottie JSONs in assets/lottie/ and asset tokens.
- Updated pubspec.yaml to include assets.
- Added simple design tokens and motion spec documents (markdown) for handoff.

Note: The assistant created placeholder assets (GIFs, PNG icons, Lottie JSON placeholders) so the UI feels populated. These are illustrative — for production, replace with high-fidelity assets, real Lottie animations, and licensed fonts (Poppins, Inter, Baloo).
