## Overview
Safe water is key to health. This section explains simple steps communities and households can use to improve water quality.

## Household-level Treatments
- Boiling: simple, effective for biological contaminants. Boil for at least 1 minute (3 minutes above 2000m altitude).
- Filtration: ceramic filters, sand filters, and household gravity filters.
- Solar disinfection (SODIS): use PET bottles and sunlight; effective for some pathogens.
- Chlorination: safe dosing guidelines and handling instructions.

## Community-level Treatments
- Coagulation & Flocculation: removes suspended particles.
- Sedimentation & Filtration: multi-stage filtration systems.
- Disinfection: chlorination or UV treatment at scale.
- Wastewater management: containment, treatment ponds, and constructed wetlands.

## Sanitation Practices
- Safe latrine use & maintenance
- Handwashing with soap at critical times
- Proper disposal of waste & animal carcasses
